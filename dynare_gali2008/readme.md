This folder contains Dynare and auxiliary MATLAB code that replicate and extend results (IRFs, determinacy analysis, etc.) of Gali (2008):
- ch4_nk_taylor_minimal.mod solves, creates IRFs and performs GSA for three variants of the basic NK model with Taylor rules found in chapters 3 and 4. This is a minimalistic implementation. It's meant to be run from the .m file ch4_nk_taylor_minimal_compare.m. However, it can be run on its own (no comparison between model variants) by commenting out @#include "taylor_rules.txt" and uncommenting one of the three lines with Taylor rules. Output file names will differ if run from the .m file or on its own;
- ch4_nk_taylor_minimal_compare.m runs ch4_nk_taylor_minimal.mod for the three model variants (three different Taylor rules). Among the other output files and folders, results.tex summarizes and compares IRFs and GSAs across models.
