This folder contains Dynare and auxiliary MATLAB code that replicate and extend results (IRFs, determinacy analysis, etc.) of Gali (2008):
- ch4_nk_taylor_minimal.mod solves for three variants of the basic NK model with Taylor rules from chapters 3 and 4, creates IRFs and performs GSA. This is a minimalistic implementation. It's meant to be run from the .m file ch4_nk_taylor_compare.m. However, it can be run on its own (no comparison between model variants) by commenting out @#include "taylor_rules.txt" and uncommenting one of the three lines with Taylor rules. Output file names will differ if run from the .m file or on its own;
- ch4_nk_taylor.mod is a richer implementation than ch4_nk_taylor_minimal.mod. The same rules on how to run it apply; 
- ch4_nk_taylor_compare.m runs ch4_nk_taylor_minimal.mod or ch4_nk_taylor.mod (define which one in the user input section) for the three model variants (three different Taylor rules). Among  other output files and folders, it creates results.tex, which summarizes and compares IRFs and GSAs across models.
